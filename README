2. Add a 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 box: `vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box`
3. Create and enter a directory that will contain your LocalWiki work, e.g. `~/localwiki-project/`
4. Clone this repository.
5. Clone the LocalWiki repository alongside this repository.
6. Create an empty localwiki_data folder, which be mounted at `/usr/share/localwiki` to store LocalWiki's data files.
7. Run `vagrant up`.
